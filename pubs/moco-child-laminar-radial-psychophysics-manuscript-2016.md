## Methods and Materials  
### Participants  

#### Experiment 1: Adults

#### Experiment 2: Children

X children, (X  female) between three and 5 and 8 years of age participated in the study. The mean age was X months (SD=X). The sample consisted of children drawn from a database of families in Centre County, Pennsylvania. Children were excluded if they were born prematurely, had a history of serious visual or medical problems, epilepsy, or seizures. We obtained written consent to participate from parents or guardians on behalf of the children under procedures approved by the Institutional Review Board of The Pennsylvania State University (#37946). The research was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Stimuli

The stimulus was generated on an iMac computer using MATLAB (XX) and Psychtoolbox (XXX). The display consisted of two side-by-side, time varying (1.2 Hz coherent/incoherent cycle) annular-shaped (18 deg outer/5 deg inner diameter) optic flow displays with a fixation dot centrally located between the two circular random dot kinematogram displays. One display depicted random (0% coherent) motion while the other depicted a radial or linear motion pattern at one of four fixed coherence levels in one of two coherence level profiles (20, 40, 60, 80%) or (15, 30, 45, 60%). Each of the 8 combinations of coherence patterns and coherence levels appeared once on the left display and once on the right display for a total of 16 conditions within a block. Condition order varied randomly within a block. Five blocks were completed within a single run resulting in 80 trials per run.


### Procedures

Upon arrival at the laboratory, study and visit procedures were described and informed consent was obtained. Visual acuity was measured for each participant with the Snellen Visual Acuity chart. Participants were escorted into a dimly lit testing room and seated 60cm in front of the computer monitor. 

#### Experiment 1

#### Experiment 2
The experimenter remained in the testing room for the entire study. Four runs were presented to the participant in a single visit with 2 runs at a speed of 2 deg/s and 2 runs at a speed of 8 deg/s presented in a **balanced random order**. Each trial had a 10 second response time limit. Child observers fixated centrally and judged which side contained coherent motion, indicating their choice by pointing to the monitor. The choice (left/right) was entered by the experimenter using a XX controller. The entire data collection session was video recorded. Participants were given the option to take a break after each run.

### Analysis

Each run generated an output file containing pattern type, coherence level, reaction time and accuracy for each trial.   



From Abstract:

We analyzed the proportion of correct responses and response times using generalized linear mixed effects modeling in R. As predicted, the proportion of correct judgments increased and the response times of correct judgements declined with increasing motion coherence. Fast optic flow patterns were perceived more reliably than slow, and radial patterns were perceived more reliably than linear patterns. Taken together the results suggest that school-age children's abilities to detect radial and linear optic flow patterns in noise are somewhat less precise than adults', although their biases toward faster radial patterns are adult-like. Combined with other prior EEG results, these data suggest that optic flow processing networks mature rapidly from infancy, but undergo less rapid, subtler change from mid-childhood to adulthood.
