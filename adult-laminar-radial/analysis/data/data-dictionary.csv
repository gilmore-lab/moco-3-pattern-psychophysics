"Block","Integer: Indicates the order in which participants made groups of judgments. A block consists of 16 individual trials -- 2 sides (Left or Right) x 2 PatternTypes (Radial or Laminar) x 4 Coherence (Coh) levels"
"Trial","Integer: Index within a block indicating trial order."
"PatternType","Character/String: {Radial, Laminar}"
"LeftCoh","Real: Proportion of dots on left side moving coherently."
"RightCoh","Real: Proportion of dots on right side moving coherently."
"Response","Character: Which display, left or right (L or R) did participant chose as the changing side?"
"RT","Real: Reaction time in seconds from start of trial to choice."
"Acc","Boolean: Did participant choose side with non-zero coherence?"
"SessionDate","Date: Date of testing session in YYYY-MM-DD format."
"ParticipantID","Integer: Participant Identifier 001-999."
"Coh","Real: Proportion of dots moving coherently in the non-zero display on the left or right."
"Run","Integer: Order of presentation for the speed conditions. A run consists of 5 blocks of 16 trials."
"DegPSec","Integer: Speed of dot motion in degrees of visual angle per second."
